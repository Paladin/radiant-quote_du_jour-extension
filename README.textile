h3. To Do

Purpose of this version is to slightly improve the efficiency of dealing with the quote table. I did it as preparation for expanding the quote table, including categories for the quotations and the ability to randomize not only within an author's quotes, but eventually within quotes pertaining to a specific category as well.
